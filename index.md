# Milana Gorobchenko!
## Creativity, Leadership, Design

### *Welcome!* My name is **Milana Gorobchenko**


> “Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it” - Goethe

I could start by saying that I am a fourth-year computer science major but what does that actually tell you about me? Not much.

Instead, I'd like to share with you a little piece of me.
Growing up, I always been a curious and creative person. I fell in love with art and dance. At the same time, I've always loved the perfection of mathematics and the mysteriousness of code. 
### Now I aspire to lead humanity to the future of art and technology.
