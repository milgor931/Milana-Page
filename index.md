## About Me

> Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it

I could start by saying that I am a fourth-year computer science major but what does that actually tell you about me? Not much.

Instead, I'd like to share with you a little piece of me.
Growing up, I always been a curious and creative person. I fell in love with art and dance. At the same time, I've always loved the perfection of mathematics and the mysteriousness of code. 
### Now I aspire to lead humanity into the future of art and technology.

```python
print("HELLO WORLD! WELCOME TO THE FUTURE")
```

### My Software Engineering Experience
1. Code Coach for over 4 years at TheCoderSchool in Fremont, CA.
2. For a series of 4 summer internships, I worked directly with the COO of Walters & Wolf Glass Company to develop enterprise solutions.
3. Worked as Professor Mary McKay's Teacher's Assistant at UCSD for Managing Diverse Teams and Business and Organizational Leadership since Fall 2024.
